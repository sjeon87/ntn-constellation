// Kepler + J2 secular propagator with a TLE-compatible interface
// (Roadmap §3 T5). Despite the class name, this is NOT a full SGP4
// implementation.
//
// The v2.1 baseline uses an analytic Kepler propagator with secular J2
// corrections to RAAN and argument-of-perigee. This is accurate to within
// a few km over hours of propagation for the typical near-circular LEO
// constellations this module targets (Walker-Delta Starlink shell 1,
// OneWeb, Kuiper). Full Vallado SGP4 — including atmospheric drag — is
// planned for Q4 2026 (T5 follow-on); until then the TLE drag term (B*)
// is parsed by TleRecord but UNUSED by this propagator. The
// classical-element interface is identical so the backend swap is
// transparent to consumers.
//
// Position is cached at 100 ms grain per roadmap §3 T5 to avoid
// re-evaluating Kepler's equation on every DoGetPosition() call from
// densely scheduled events.
//
// Two coordinate-system surfaces:
//   GetPosition() / DoGetPosition() returns ECEF metres (rotates with
//     Earth at omega = 7.2921159e-5 rad/s). This is what ns-3 mobility
//     consumers (link budgets, mobility-aware xApps) expect.
//   GetEciPosition() returns the inertial ECI position for ground-track
//     tooling.
